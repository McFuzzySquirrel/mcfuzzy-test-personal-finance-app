# Skill: Build a Custom Agent Team from a PRD

You are building a team of GitHub Copilot custom agents and reusable skills from a Product Requirements Document (PRD) or technical specification. The goal is to produce a set of specialist `.md` files that can be committed to a repository so Copilot can act as each team member.

---

## Process

### Step 1: Locate and Analyze the PRD

Find the project's PRD or specification document. Look in common locations:

- `docs/PRD.md`
- `docs/spec.md`
- `README.md` (if it contains detailed requirements)

Read the **entire** document and extract the following:

1. **Technology stack** — Languages, frameworks, engines, build tools, package managers.
2. **Project structure** — File/folder layout, module boundaries, entry points.
3. **Functional requirement groups** — Distinct feature areas (e.g., "Player Ship", "Wave System", "HUD").
4. **Non-functional requirements** — Performance, security, accessibility, offline support.
5. **Implementation phases** — How the work is broken into ordered stages.
6. **Testing strategy** — Test frameworks, coverage expectations, test scenarios.
7. **Cross-cutting concerns** — Audio, visual effects, deployment, CI/CD.

### Step 2: Identify Specialist Roles

Map the PRD's domains to specialist agent roles. Each agent should own a **distinct, non-overlapping area** of the project. Use the following heuristics:

#### Required Agents (create for every project)

| Role Pattern | When to Create | Owns |
|---|---|---|
| **Project Architect** | Always | Project scaffolding, build config, dependency management, folder structure |
| **QA / Test Engineer** | Always | Test framework setup, unit/integration tests, test scenarios from PRD |

#### Domain Agents (create based on tech stack)

| Role Pattern | When to Create | Owns |
|---|---|---|
| **[Framework] Specialist** | When a major framework/engine is used | Framework initialization, core APIs, rendering/routing/etc. |
| **Backend Engineer** | When there is a server, API, or database layer | API endpoints, data models, database, authentication |
| **Frontend Engineer** | When there is a web/mobile UI (not framework-specific) | Pages, components, layouts, client-side routing |
| **DevOps / Infra Engineer** | When there is deployment, CI/CD, or infrastructure | Dockerfiles, CI pipelines, cloud config, monitoring |
| **PWA / Offline Specialist** | When offline support, Service Workers, or caching is required | Service Worker, manifest, cache strategy |

#### Feature Agents (create based on functional requirement groups)

| Role Pattern | When to Create | Owns |
|---|---|---|
| **Core Logic Engineer** | When there is substantial business/game logic | State machines, core algorithms, domain rules |
| **Physics / Simulation Engineer** | When physics or simulation is a distinct subsystem | Physics engine integration, collision, simulation tuning |
| **UI / HUD Developer** | When UI is a separate concern from rendering | UI components, overlays, menus, accessibility |
| **VFX / Animation Artist** | When visual effects are a distinct subsystem | Particles, animations, transitions, visual polish |
| **Audio Engineer** | When audio/sound is specified in the PRD | Sound loading, playback, spatial audio, music |
| **Data / Analytics Engineer** | When telemetry, analytics, or data pipelines are required | Event tracking, dashboards, data models |
| **Security Engineer** | When security is a major concern (auth, encryption, compliance) | Auth flows, encryption, RBAC, compliance |

**Naming conventions:**
- Agent names must be **lowercase with hyphens**: `checkout-engineer`, `notifications-specialist`.
- Names should be **role-descriptive**, not person-names.
- Prefer established industry role titles that are intuitive.

### Step 3: Define Agent Boundaries

For each agent, determine:

1. **Expertise** — 4–8 bullet points of their technical specializations.
2. **Key Reference** — Which PRD sections they must consult (cite by section number).
3. **Responsibilities** — Numbered list of specific deliverables, grouped by component/file.
4. **Constraints** — Rules they must follow (e.g., "do not modify production code", "strict TypeScript").
5. **Output Standards** — Where their files go, coding conventions, API patterns.
6. **Collaboration** — Which other agents they depend on or coordinate with.

**Boundary rules:**
- No two agents should own the same file or responsibility.
- Every PRD functional requirement must map to exactly one agent.
- Agents should reference PRD section numbers, not copy entire requirements.
- If an agent's responsibilities list exceeds ~15 items, consider splitting into two agents.

### Step 4: Identify Reusable Skills

Skills are **process templates** that any agent can invoke for common, repeatable tasks. Analyze the PRD for patterns that will be repeated across the project:

| Skill Pattern | When to Create | Example |
|---|---|---|
| **Scaffold [entity type]** | When multiple similar entities/components will be created | `create-data-model`, `create-api-endpoint`, `create-react-component` |
| **Set up [subsystem]** | When a complex subsystem requires multi-step initialization | `setup-auth-provider`, `setup-database`, `setup-ci-pipeline` |
| **Create [effect/asset]** | When a category of assets will be produced repeatedly | `create-dashboard-widget`, `create-migration`, `create-test-suite` |
| **Implement [UI pattern]** | When UI follows a repeatable pattern | `implement-ui-screen`, `implement-form`, `implement-dashboard-widget` |

**Skill naming conventions:**
- Lowercase with hyphens: `create-data-model`, `setup-database`.
- Use verb-noun format: `create-X`, `setup-X`, `implement-X`, `build-X`.

### Step 5: Write the Agent Files

Create each agent file at `.github/agents/{agent-name}.md` using this template:

````markdown
---
name: {agent-name}
description: >
  {One-sentence summary of expertise and when to use this agent.
  Reference the project name and specific technology domains.}
---

You are a **{Role Title}** responsible for {one-sentence scope description}.

---

## Expertise

- {Technical specialization 1}
- {Technical specialization 2}
- {Technical specialization 3}
- {4–8 items total}

---

## Key Reference

Always consult [{PRD path}]({relative path to PRD}) for the authoritative project requirements. The relevant sections for your work are:

- **Section {N} — {Title}**: {What it covers for this agent}
- {List all relevant PRD sections}

---

## Responsibilities

### {Component/Area 1} (`{file path}`)

1. {Specific deliverable referencing PRD requirement IDs where applicable}
2. {Next deliverable}

### {Component/Area 2} (`{file path}`)

3. {Deliverable}
4. {Deliverable}

---

## Constraints

- {Rule 1 — referencing PRD requirement IDs}
- {Rule 2}

---

## Output Standards

- {Where files go}
- {Coding conventions}
- {API patterns}

---

## Collaboration

- **{other-agent-name}** — {What they provide or need from this agent}.
- **{other-agent-name}** — {Coordination point}.
````

### Step 6: Write the Skill Files

Create each skill file at `.github/skills/{skill-name}/SKILL.md` using this template:

````markdown
---
name: {skill-name}
description: >
  {One-sentence summary of what this skill does and when Copilot should use it.}
---

# Skill: {Human-Readable Title}

{One-sentence context about what this skill produces.}

---

## Process

### Step 1: {First Step Title}

{Instructions for the first step, including decision criteria or lookup tables.}

### Step 2: {Second Step Title}

{Instructions with code templates, examples, or scaffolding patterns.}

{Use fenced code blocks with language tags for any code templates:}

```{language}
// Template code here
```

### Step 3: {Additional Steps}

{Continue with as many steps as needed for the process.}

---

## Reference

See [{PRD path}]({relative path to PRD}) for the full specification:

- **Section {N}** — {What it covers}
````

### Step 7: Validate the Team

Before finalizing, verify:

- [ ] Every PRD functional requirement (Section 8+) maps to exactly one agent.
- [ ] Every agent has a `## Collaboration` section listing agents it depends on.
- [ ] No two agents own the same file path or responsibility.
- [ ] Agent files use valid YAML frontmatter with `name` and `description`.
- [ ] Skill files use valid YAML frontmatter with `name` and `description`.
- [ ] All PRD section references are accurate (check section numbers).
- [ ] Agent names are lowercase-hyphenated and match the filename (minus `.md`).
- [ ] Skill directory names match the skill `name` field.
- [ ] The team covers: foundation/scaffolding, core logic, testing, and all major feature areas.

### Step 8: Present the Team

Summarize the team in a table:

```markdown
## Custom Agents

| Agent | Role | Primary PRD Sections | Phase |
|-------|------|---------------------|-------|
| `{name}` | {role} | {sections} | {implementation phase} |

## Skills

| Skill | Purpose | Used By |
|-------|---------|---------|
| `{name}` | {what it does} | {which agents use it} |

## Collaboration Map

{agent-a} → {agent-b}: {what flows between them}
```

---

## Guidelines

- **Scale to the project.** A weekend prototype may need 3–4 agents. A large application may need 8–12. Don't create agents for areas the PRD doesn't cover.
- **Agents are specialists, not generalists.** Each agent should be the undisputed expert in their area. If you can't articulate their unique expertise in one sentence, merge them with another agent.
- **Skills are reusable processes.** Only create a skill if the process will be invoked multiple times across the project. One-off tasks belong in an agent's responsibilities, not a separate skill.
- **Reference, don't duplicate.** Agents should cite PRD section numbers. Don't copy entire requirement tables into agent files — they'll go stale.
- **Keep collaboration sections honest.** Only list agents that genuinely need to coordinate. Not every agent needs to talk to every other agent.
- **Test the mapping.** For each PRD requirement, you should be able to point to exactly one agent who owns it. If a requirement is unowned, add an agent or expand an existing one. If it's dual-owned, clarify the boundary.
